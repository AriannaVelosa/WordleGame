# WordleGame
This is a group project that replicates the popular game Wordle from the New York Times. 

As part of a computer science class, we used object-oriented programming principles and
scrum to create this game. It mimics Wordle and CoWordle, with the ability to create an
account, toggle between light and dark mode, and see various statistic about the game
play. I built the code that created a functional game and worked on the main Wordle board.
I utilized JavaFX elements to add animation to the game.

To play the game, run the file that reads "LoginPane.java" and ensure you have adjusted the
run configurations to allow JavaFX. From there, enjoy playing!
